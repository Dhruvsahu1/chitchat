Let's create a very basic Express.js server. This will serve as the foundation for any web application or API you want
to build with Express.

### What is Express.js?
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web
and mobile applications. It's essentially a layer built on top of Node.js's HTTP module, making it easier to handle
routes, middleware, and other common web development tasks.

### Steps to Create Your Basic Express Server

#### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the
official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

#### 2. Set Up Your Project

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-basic-express-app
cd my-basic-express-app
```

Now, initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a `package.json` file, which manages your project's dependencies
and scripts.

```bash
npm init -y
```
The `-y` flag answers "yes" to all the prompts, creating a default `package.json`.

#### 3. Install Express

Install the Express.js framework as a dependency for your project:

```bash
npm install express
```
This command downloads Express and adds it to the `dependencies` section in your `package.json` file.

#### 4. Create Your Server File

Now, create a new file (e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`) in your project directory and add the following code:

```javascript
// server.js

// 1. Import the Express module
const express = require('express');

// 2. Create an Express application instance
const app = express();

// 3. Define the port the server will listen on
// Use process.env.PORT for deployment, fallback to 3000 for local development
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// --- Middleware (Optional but good to include for API-based servers) ---
// These lines allow your server to parse JSON and URL-encoded data from incoming requests.
// While not strictly needed for this basic GET request, they are essential for POST/PUT requests.
app.use(express.json()); // For parsing application/json
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // For parsing application/x-www-form-urlencoded

// --- Define a basic route ---
// 4. Handle a GET request to the root URL ("/")
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
// req: Request object (contains info about the incoming request)
// res: Response object (used to send a response back to the client)

// Send a simple text response
res.send('Hello from your Basic Express Server!');
});

// --- Handle a simple custom route ---
app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
res.send('This is a basic Express application.');
});

// --- Basic 404 Not Found Handler (Optional, but good practice) ---
// This middleware will be hit if no other routes match the request.
app.use((req, res) => {
res.status(404).send('<h1>404 Not Found</h1>');
});


// 5. Start the server and listen for incoming requests
app.listen(PORT, () => {
console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
console.log('Press Ctrl+C to stop the server');
});
```

#### 5. Run Your Server

Open your terminal or command prompt, make sure you are in your project directory (`my-basic-express-app`), and then run
your server file:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see the message:

```
Server is running on http://localhost:3000
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

#### 6. Test Your Server

Open your web browser and go to:

* `http://localhost:3000/`
You should see: `Hello from your Basic Express Server!`

* `http://localhost:3000/about`
You should see: `This is a basic Express application.`

* `http://localhost:3000/something-else`
You should see: `<h1>404 Not Found</h1>` (from your 404 handler)

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **`const express = require('express');`**: This line imports the Express.js module. It makes all the Express
functionalities available in your `server.js` file.
2. **`const app = express();`**: This creates an instance of the Express application. `app` is now your main Express
object, and you'll use it to configure routes, middleware, and start the server.
3. **`const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;`**: This defines the port number on which your server will listen.
* `process.env.PORT` is used in production environments (e.g., Heroku, Netlify) where the hosting platform assigns a
port.
* `3000` is a common fallback for local development.
4. **`app.use(express.json());` and `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`**: These are **middleware**
functions.
* Middleware functions have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware
function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
* `express.json()`: Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads (e.g., from a client sending JSON data in the request
body).
* `express.urlencoded()`: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (e.g., from HTML forms).
* They populate `req.body` with the parsed data.
5. **`app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... });`**: This defines a **route handler**.
* `app.get()`: Specifies that this handler will respond to HTTP GET requests.
* `/`: This is the path (or URL) that this handler will match (in this case, the root path).
* `(req, res) => { ... }`: This is the callback function that gets executed when a GET request is made to the `/` path.
* `req`: The request object, containing information about the incoming HTTP request (headers, query parameters, body,
etc.).
* `res`: The response object, used to send a response back to the client (e.g., `res.send()`, `res.json()`,
`res.status()`).
* `res.send('Hello from your Basic Express Server!');`: Sends a simple text string as the HTTP response.
6. **`app.use((req, res) => { ... });`**: This is a general middleware that acts as a **404 handler**. Because it's
placed *after* all other routes, it will only be executed if no previous `app.get`, `app.post`, etc., calls have handled
the request. It sends a 404 status code and a message.
7. **`app.listen(PORT, () => { ... });`**: This starts the Express server.
* It tells the server to listen for incoming requests on the specified `PORT`.
* The callback function (`() => { ... }`) is executed once the server successfully starts listening.

This basic setup provides the fundamental structure for any Express.js application!
